Here you can see a list of houses that you (as an admin may be) can delete, change data in it and adding new post. But about it later.

First of all choose post you wanna change. Click to pencil and changing menu opened. There you can change any data you want: picture, title, price and so on.


## How can I edit photos and post we one?

You can do it quite easy. First off all choose picture you wanna change, click to it (picture must disappear), choose another photos you wanna post and click submit button to confirm changes

But if you misclick and your picture dissapear, just click pencil again to cancel changes. After that click pencil again to continue making changes.


## How can I add new post to the list?

Of course you can! I can say more: you can delete every post you want to. Deleted post/posts will be removed from database too. Therefore be carefull as an admin :)


## I see filter here, does it working?
https://github.com/b1on1kkk/YandexEda-webpage/assets/114521829/a47c01c2-ce96-4b93-aa1c-9e31acd1e1b1

Sure, it is working. You can filter posts by location and price together. Also filter only by price or location.




That's it, thanks for your attention! :)
